Repository for the 6th weekly challenge for fintech bootcamp


Part 1: Calculate and Plot the Housing Units per Year
  Found that housing units appear to be steadily rising in the San Francisco area, rising from 372,000 to 384,000...growing at a rate of about 2,000 housing units each year.
  
 Part 2: Calculate Sales Price per Square Foot by Year
  Found that there was only one instance where sales price by sq ft declined from previous year (from 2010 to 2011).
  Also, Despite the drop in average sales price per square foot, gross rent increased from 1530 in 2011.
  
Part 3: Compare the Average Sale Prices by Neighborhood
  Found that rental income growth has a positive correlation with the rise in sales price. This holds true for all Neighborhoods in San Francisco.
  Also,  the cheapest sales price per sq ft is Bayview. According to the map, there is no correlation between higher sales/rent prices in regards to location within San Francisco. Meaning the entire city is growing at a high rate, no matter the area.
  
  The neighborhood with the highest gross rent is Westwood Park. The neighborhood with the lowest gross rent is Jordan Park.
  
  Overall: I felt that the dataframe we were given was incomplete as many neighborhoods only had a few years of data to go off of.  I would take this analysis with a grain of salt.
